Over the past few years in Southern New Hampshire Universityâ€™s computer science program, I have progressed from writing short single purpose blocks of code to building, testing, and documenting full end to end software. Throughout my time I have been able to diversify my learning and gain knowledge in numerous areas of computer science. This ranged from designing 3D scenes in OpenGL with C++, developing dashboard web applications utilizing Python and MongoDB, creating mobile applications with java, and many more. While each of these projects were different in fundamental aspects, they all allowed me to benefit from learning industry best practices in categories such as design, documentation, and testing across a plethora of real-world use cases. 

These previous experiences have allowed me to gain an understanding of how development might be structured by a future employer. Through my coursework I was able to collaborate in a team environment by discussing different computer science topics along with classmates and implement instructor feedback on ongoing projects. Also, I will be able to communicate my work to stakeholders effectively as I have practiced writing and recording videos describing functionality and design across multiple projects both in technical and non-technical terms. Throughout my projects I implemented my best practice into data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database, and security. Overall, my goal is to deliver solutions that are understandable, testable, and maintainable, while communicating clearly enough that others can build upon it if needed.

This ePortfolio will highlight my progression as I display my strengths in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. This artifact is a weight tracking android application that I built for the CS360 class in the spring of 2024. I selected this artifact to include in my ePortfolio because it is a good demonstration of my ability to design, develop, and enhance a real-world mobile application. To familiarize yourself with the original version of this application below will be links for my code review, which highlights the functionality and design of the application, as well as a link to the original applications repository.
