# Professional Self-Assessment

Over the past few years in Southern New Hampshire University’s computer science program, I have progressed from writing short single purpose blocks of code to building, testing, and documenting full end to end software. Throughout my time I have been able to diversify my learning and gain knowledge in numerous areas of computer science. This ranged from designing 3D scenes in OpenGL with C++, developing dashboard web applications utilizing Python and MongoDB, creating mobile applications with java, and many more. While each of these projects were different in fundamental aspects, they all allowed me to benefit from learning industry best practices in categories such as design, documentation, and testing across a plethora of real-world use cases. 

These previous experiences have allowed me to gain an understanding of how development might be structured by a future employer. Through my coursework I was able to collaborate in a team environment by discussing different computer science topics along with classmates and implement instructor feedback on ongoing projects. Also, I will be able to communicate my work to stakeholders effectively as I have practiced writing and recording videos describing functionality and design across multiple projects both in technical and non-technical terms. Throughout my projects I implemented my best practice into data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database, and security. Overall, my goal is to deliver solutions that are understandable, testable, and maintainable, while communicating clearly enough that others can build upon it if needed.

This ePortfolio will highlight my progression as I display my strengths in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. This artifact is a weight tracking android application that I built for the CS360 class in the spring of 2024. I selected this artifact to include in my ePortfolio because it is a good demonstration of my ability to design, develop, and enhance a real-world mobile application. To familiarize yourself with the original version of this application below will be links for my code review, which highlights the functionality and design of the application, as well as a link to the original applications repository.

## 1. Software Design and Engineering

In this first enhancement, this artifact was improved to have better input validation in the multiple fields where the users are interacting with the application. In addition, I added more comments to the code so it can be better understood. With this enhancement I met the course outcome that reads, “Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.” I did so by enhancing the app to solve the issue of invalid numbers and letters being able to be submitted to fields where they are not applicable. In addition, the user is presented prompts in these scenarios to let them know where the issue has occurred. This also meets the course outcome that reads, "Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources". By ensuring that the validation methods are accurate it defends from invalid input reaching the database and the risk of leaking internal errors to the user. 

Enhancing this application taught me the importance of anticipating user input errors and being able to provide meaningful feedback. I learned to apply defensive programming techniques to handle exceptions gracefully. One challenge that I encountered during my enhancements was ensuring that all possible invalid input scenarios were handled and prompted the user with the appropriate error messages when applicable. Balancing the input validation alongside a smooth user experience required testing of all possible error scenarios to ensure they are handled correctly.
